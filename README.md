    This program stores the location of any object in the Milky Way galaxy. The program uses the Galactic Coordinate System
    for specifying an object's location relative to the Sun and the Galactic core of the Milky Way. The program also returns 
    the time it would take for any object to reach a particular location given that the speed of the object is provided in 
    meters/second
    
    The Galactic Coordinate System uses declination and Right Ascension to locate an object. 
    Declination (delta): angular distance from the celestial equator (+=north, -=south)
    Right Ascension (alpha): angular distance along circles parallel to the equator. Define zero point to be the vernal equinox,
    the point where the Sun's position crosses the celestial equator as it moves north. Right ascension increases going eastward.
    
    Dec is measured in degrees, minutes of arc, seconds of arc, or decimal degrees.
    RA is measured in either time (hr, min of time, sec of time), or in decimal degrees.
